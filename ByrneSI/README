This folder constains the supplimentary information (SI) for "Radiative forcings for 28 potential Archean greenhouse gases" by B.Byrne and C. Goldblatt (2014)

From top to bottom the directory structure of the SI is:

1) Gas name.

2) N2 pressure. For example, N2_1bar for runs with 1 bar of N2.

3) Gas abundance. Given as conc_*, where * is the negative log (base 10) of the abundance. For example, conc_2 indicated the runs with an abundance of 10^(-2) = 0.01.

The fluxes for each cloud combination and the atmospheric structures are given as text files for each case. 

The atmospheric structure is given in the file named "GAM.atm" and contains colums with the atmospheric pressure (Pa), temperature (K) and the mass mixing ratios of the atmospheric constituents.

The radiative fluxes are given in text files which are named cloud_x_y_z.hrt where x,y and z are 0 if there are no clouds in in this run or 1 if there are clouds. x represents high clouds, y represents middle clouds, and z represents low clouds.



----- New folder version for use with AtmAmm 4-box model -----

Edited on March 16, 2018 by Forest Pimm.

Supplimentary information now covers the 4 gases used in the radiative forcing script titled rf_parameter_calc.m in AtmAmm/RF_calc.

Folder has been reduced for ease of data finding and storage purposes.
